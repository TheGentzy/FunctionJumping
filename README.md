Welcome to Gents function jumper, a derivative of RawCode's weird assembly stuff...

Obsolete:

-Function Overriding using string

-Ability to directly use MethodInfo

Done:

-Event System 

ToDo:

-Some sort of method to auto duplicate the Event class for every function. (Possibly Generics)

-Allow the passing of return type and paremetters of a function to avoid an AmbiguousMatchException for functions with overrides. IN PROGRESS!

~~-When multiple Functions are added to the same event, only the last one added gets to passback its return value. Implement the passing back of an LIST of return values~~

-Support Out keyword
